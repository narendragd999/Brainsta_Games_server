let‚Äôs write the Maze Runner concept (as a game, not just the movie/book) usually revolves around so it works on both desktop (keyboard) and mobile 
Conecpt:
Core Idea:

Players are trapped inside a constantly changing maze filled with paths, traps, and obstacles. The goal is to find the exit before time runs out or before hazards catch them.

üïπÔ∏è How to Play:

Start Point: The player begins at one end of the maze.

Navigation: Move through corridors, avoid traps, and solve mini-puzzles to progress.

Dynamic Maze: The maze can shift or change at intervals (walls move, doors open/close).

Hazards/Enemies: Add elements like monsters, patrolling guards, or collapsing floors.

Power-ups: Collect boosts like speed, keys, or temporary shields.

Exit: The player must find the exit door/gate hidden deep in the maze.

üîë Game Mechanics:

Top-Down View / First-Person View (depending on style).

Timer Pressure ‚Äì players must escape before the countdown ends.

Procedural Generation ‚Äì every playthrough has a new maze layout.

Multiple Levels ‚Äì each level‚Äôs maze is larger and trickier.

Collectibles ‚Äì coins, gems, or artifacts hidden in dead-ends for extra challenges.

üß© Variations:

Survival Mode ‚Üí Survive as long as possible while the maze shrinks or fills with dangers.

Multiplayer ‚Üí Compete with friends to escape first or sabotage each other.

Puzzle Mode ‚Üí Solve logic-based riddles at checkpoints to unlock new sections.

üëâ This can be made in **Phaser.js**.
