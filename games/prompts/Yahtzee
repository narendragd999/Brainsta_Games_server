let’s write the Yahtzee game so it works on both desktop (keyboard) and mobile 
Conecpt:
Get the highest total score by rolling dice and filling in a scorecard with specific combinations.

🧩 How It Works

Players: 1 or more (best with 2–6).

Equipment: 5 dice, scorecard, and pencil.

Turns: Each player gets 13 turns (to fill 13 categories on the scorecard).

🔄 Turn Structure

Roll all 5 dice.

After each roll, you can keep some dice and re-roll the others (up to 3 rolls total per turn).

After your rolls, you must choose one category on the scorecard to score that turn.

Once a category is used, it can’t be used again.

📜 Scorecard Categories
Upper Section (simple sums):

Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes → Add up dice of that number.

Example: Roll 2,2,4,5,6 → Score 4 in “Twos”.

Lower Section (special combos):

Three of a Kind → At least 3 same dice, score total of all dice.

Four of a Kind → At least 4 same dice, score total of all dice.

Full House → 3 of one number + 2 of another = 25 points.

Small Straight → Sequence of 4 (e.g., 2-3-4-5) = 30 points.

Large Straight → Sequence of 5 (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5) = 40 points.

Yahtzee → All 5 dice the same = 50 points.

Chance → Anything, score total of all dice.

🎁 Bonuses

Upper Section Bonus: If the total of Ones–Sixes is ≥ 63, add +35.

Extra Yahtzee: If you roll another Yahtzee after the first, bonus points.

🏆 Winning

After all 13 categories are filled, total the scores. Highest score wins.
