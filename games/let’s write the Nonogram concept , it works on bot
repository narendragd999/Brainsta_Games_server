A jigsaw puzzle is a type of tiling puzzle that consists of a picture or image mounted on a base (such as cardboard or wood) and cut into small, irregularly shaped interlocking pieces, which must be reassembled by fitting them together to recreate the original picture. These puzzles originated in the late 18th century as educational tools for children and have since become popular recreational activities for all ages, often featuring themes like landscapes, artwork, or maps. The term "jigsaw" derives from the jigsaw tool used to cut the pieces, though modern puzzles are typically die-cut for precision.
